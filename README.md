# XML to CSV

Quickly and easily convert clunky .xml files to elegant csv files without the need for any manual cleanup. Just upload your file, click convert, and the app will automatically generate your csv file and download it once the process is finished. Plus, once the app has handled your conversion, all associated data is wiped from memory. None of your sensitive files can ever be retrieved by a bad actor.
